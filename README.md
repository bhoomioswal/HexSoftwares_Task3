# HexSoftwares_Task3
Covid 19 Data Analysis Using Python
📌 Project Overview:
This project analyzes Covid-19 real-time data to study the spread, impact, and patterns of the virus across countries.
It collects, cleans, and visualizes Covid-19 cases, recoveries, deaths, and vaccination data using Python.
The aim is to:
--Identify patterns and trends in Covid-19 cases.
--Analyze the impact of vaccination rates on new cases.
--Understand fatality ratios (CFR) and other key indicators.
--Provide data-driven insights through visualizations.


🛠️ Tech Stack:
Python 3
Pandas → Data cleaning & manipulation
NumPy → Numerical computations
Matplotlib → Data visualization

⚙️ Features:

 Auto-downloads global Covid-19 dataset from OWID
 Cleans & preprocesses missing/incorrect values
 Calculates 7-day moving averages for cases & deaths
 Computes Case Fatality Ratio (CFR)
 Analyzes correlation between vaccination rates & new cases
 Saves cleaned dataset for further analysis

 📊 Visualizations:

New Cases (7-day moving average)
New Deaths (7-day moving average)
Total Cases (cumulative trend)
Vaccination Share vs New Cases



📂 Output:
Cleaned dataset: outputs/covid_cleaned.csv
Visual plots (time series & scatter plots)
Latest summary statistics

📌 Example Insights:
How vaccination impacts daily new cases
Patterns of infection peaks and declines
Correlation between fatality ratios and total cases

🙌 What I Learned:

Data preprocessing & cleaning in Python
Handling real-world datasets with missing values
Using rolling averages for trend detection
Creating meaningful visualizations for health data
Automating dataset downloads with requests
